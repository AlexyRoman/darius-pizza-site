      "intro": "Our story doesn't begin with flour, but with the knife. Before becoming Darius Pizza, our house was an essential address in Cavalaire, founded in 1936. From 1966, it became \"Maison Darius\", a family butcher shop renowned for its rigor, expertise and uncompromising quality of its products.",
      "conclusion": "In 2020, a new chapter opened. The passion for Italian gastronomy and exceptional products transformed the counter into a wood-fired oven. Maison Darius became Darius Pizza.\n\nThe decor has changed, but the soul remains intact. We have preserved the butcher shop's heritage: love for fresh products, respect for artisanal know-how and an obsession with taste. This rigor that we applied to our meats, we now apply to every ingredient that makes up our pizzas.",
