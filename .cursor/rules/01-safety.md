# Critical Safety Rules

CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Before you execute any terminal command that modifies the file system, installs packages, or interacts with git (e.g., `git`, `rm`, `npm install`, `supabase`), you MUST explicitly write out the full command and ask for my permission to run it. This is the most important rule and must not be violated.

## Additional Safety Guidelines

- **File System Operations**: Always ask before creating, modifying, or deleting files
- **Package Management**: Never install packages without explicit permission
- **Git Operations**: Always show the exact git command before execution
- **Database Operations**: Confirm all database changes before applying
- **Environment Variables**: Never expose sensitive information in code or logs
