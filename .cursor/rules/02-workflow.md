# Workflow Rules

WORKFLOW RULE: You must operate based on a task breakdown provided in a markdown file. Follow the "Nuclear Steps" in the exact order they are written. Do not proceed to the next step until I have confirmed the current one is complete and its checks have passed. When a step is done, you will update the markdown file to check the corresponding box.

## Workflow Guidelines

- **Sequential Execution**: Follow steps in exact order
- **Verification Required**: Each step must pass all checks
- **Progress Tracking**: Update task files to mark completion
- **No Skipping**: Do not proceed without completing current step
- **Clear Communication**: Always explain what you're doing and why
